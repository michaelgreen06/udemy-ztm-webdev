W3C SideTrack Learning Notes

- let doesn't allow re-declaration of variables
	- var does
- let & const have block scope
	- block scope was intro'd in 2015
- Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time
- Variables defined with let are also hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.
- Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.
- As a general rule, always declare a variable with const unless you know that the value will change.
- Variables defined with const are also hoisted to the top, but not initialized.
- Inside a function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.
- Accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result.
- A method is a function stored as a property.
- In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.
- Avoid String, Number, and Boolean objects. They complicate your code and slow down execution speed.
